## My process 

I made this project with HTML, CSS. I used grid for the layout of my elements. and also I used media query for responsiveness.

### Built with 

- Semantic HTML5 markup 
- CSS custom properties 
- CSS Grid 

### What I Learned 

I learned about CSS Grid. so I used my learnig to make my project with the help of Grid. and I was quite make sense to me that what happing with my elements's position, Developer tools was also quite helpful in this process.
I also learned about media query. but I still need to learn lot about them. 

### Continued development 

I still need to learn lot of things. few of them are position, flexbox properties, media query, background properties.
